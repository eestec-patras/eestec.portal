Tunneling to ETHZ server
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Sometimes you need direct access to services running on ETHZ server. All servers
are running on local address 127.0.0.2, and the ports for them are as follows:

zope1       = 8091
zope2       = 8092
zope3       = 8093
zope4       = 8094
zope4_debug = 8099 (needs to be manually started with ``bin/zope_debug fg``)
zeo         = 8090
haproxy     = 8080
supervisor  = 9000


So, to access (for example) zope_debug use:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ ssh eestecwm@galen.ee.ethz.ch -L 8099:127.0.0.2:8099
    
Then open ``http://localhost:8099`` in your browser and you will directly access the
service on this port.
